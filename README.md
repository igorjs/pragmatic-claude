# pragmatic-claude

My personal [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) setup: a zsh launcher, session hooks, a custom system prompt, skills, slash commands, and a statusline. It lives at `~/.claude` and replaces the default config directory.

## Requirements

| Tool | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` on PATH | required | Claude Code itself |
| zsh | required for `cc` | the launcher is zsh-only; run `claude` directly from any shell without it |
| `git`, `jq`, `bash`, `shasum` | required | used by hooks and the install script |
| `python3` 3.9+ | required | used by two bash hooks (path resolution and the memory-graph rebuild); the hooks themselves are bash |
| `rtk` (Rust Token Killer) | required | a PreToolUse hook routes every Bash command through it to cut token use |
| `gh` | optional | statusline PR and CI status |
| `agent-browser` | optional | browser automation MCP used by `/brainstorm` for web-only tickets and attachments |

## Install

Config lives at `~/.claude` (all paths are hardcoded to `$HOME/.claude`).

Quickest, no clone:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igorjs/pragmatic-claude/main/install.sh | bash
```

Downloads the latest release (or `main` if none exists), backs up anything it replaces to `~/.claude/backups/`, runs `brew bundle`, adds the launcher to `~/.zshrc`, and opens a fresh shell. Pin a version or install files only:

```bash
PRAGMATIC_CLAUDE_REF=v0.1.0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igorjs/pragmatic-claude/main/install.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igorjs/pragmatic-claude/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-setup
```

Pin `PRAGMATIC_CLAUDE_REF` to a tag or commit for a reproducible, reviewable install: the same files every run, and a ref you inspect first.

Prefer git? Clone fresh:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igorjs/pragmatic-claude.git ~/.claude
```

Already have a `~/.claude` from Claude Code? Adopt it in place. The `.gitignore` is an allowlist, so sessions, caches, and runtime files stay ignored:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/igorjs/pragmatic-claude.git
git fetch origin
git checkout -f main
```

Add the launcher to `.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.claude/shell/cc.zsh
```

Reload with `exec zsh`.

## Usage

```bash
cc                     # resume this directory's last session, or start fresh
ccd                    # same, with --dangerously-skip-permissions
cc fresh               # new session, no history
cc list                # recent sessions for this directory
cc clean               # resume with /model, /effort, /config, /output-style, /style stripped
cc raw [id]            # resume verbatim, no fork or cleanup
cc worktree <branch>   # create/enter a git worktree, then start a session there
cc new <branch>        # alias for cc worktree
```

`cc` loads the system prompt, picks a model, and prunes old transcripts (keeps the newest 5; set `CCD_KEEP` to change, `CCD_KEEP=0` disables).

`cc worktree` (also `ccd worktree`) creates or enters a worktree off the project's base branch, grouped under `<repo-parent>/.worktrees/<repo>/<folder>` (set `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` to change the base folder). It names the folder after the JIRA key in the branch name, copies `.env`, reuses `node_modules` via hardlinks, sets upstream, and runs a daily background cleanup of merged or stale worktrees. Claude auto-resolves rebase conflicts (`--ai-resolve` is always set). Only available via `cc`/`ccd`. `cc new <branch>` is an alias for `cc worktree`.

## Docs

Full documentation: [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md).

- **Concepts** (`docs/concepts/`): system prompt design and the memory system.
- **Guides** (`docs/guides/`): plan-and-implement, review and PR flow, decisions and memory.
- **Authoring** (`docs/authoring/`): writing commands, skills, and hooks.
- **Internals** (`docs/internals/`): launcher, hooks, model routing, and memory injection.

## System prompt

`prompts/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` is passed as `--system-prompt-file` on every `cc` session. It sets the persona (senior principal engineer, security specialization) and the rules every session follows: terse output, voice rules for prose, `rtk` integration, model routing, TDD, verification, and the memory protocol. Edit it to change how sessions behave; changes take effect on the next fresh session.

## Commands

Slash commands live in `commands/`. See [docs/guides](docs/guides) for full usage.

- `/brainstorm`: divergent discovery session; explores a raw idea, weighs approaches, and produces an approved design doc that hands off to `/scope`.
- `/scope`: interview-driven planning; saves a verified, parallel-safe plan to `.claude/plans/` for `/implement`.
- `/implement`: executes a `/scope` plan or `/adr` blueprint with subagents and TDD, committing each work unit. `--auto` opens a PR.
- `/adr`: creates an Architecture Decision Record through investigate → draft → quality-gate → finalise. Saves to `.claude/adr/`.
- `/commit-and-push`: writes a commit message from the staged diff, commits signed, optionally rebases, then pushes.
- `/create-pull-request`: opens a PR with pre-flight checks, a conventional-commit title, and the team PR template.
- `/quick-review`: single-pass PR review using the `grounding-review` discipline, posted as a pending GitHub review.
- `/deep-review`: multi-agent PR review; spawns specialist subagents in parallel, consolidates findings, posts a pending review.
- `/address-pr-comments`: walks unresolved PR comments, applies fixes or drafts replies, then pushes and posts replies.
- `/learn-project`: analyses the repo (git history, code, PRs, JIRA/Confluence) and writes distilled facts to memory. Read-only; confirms before writing.
- `/repo-audit`: read-only four-phase repository audit (discovery, findings, strategy, task plan).

## Skills

Skills live in `skills/` and load on demand. See [docs/authoring/01-commands-skills-hooks.md](docs/authoring/01-commands-skills-hooks.md).

- `grounding-review`: review discipline; severity levels, Conventional Comments, proof ladder, verification summary.
- `grounding-research`: investigation discipline; citation rules (every claim sourced to file:line), structured findings, scope boundaries.
- `engineering-standards`: PR readiness, test types, mocking rules, incremental delivery, deployment flow.
- `engineering-standards-javascript`: JS/TS companion to `engineering-standards`; covers Zod validation and Jest/Vitest mocking.
- `writing-style`: voice rules for human-facing prose; spartan, active voice, contractions, no dashes.
- `session-handoff`: decision-first handoff so the next session picks up cold without rereading the thread.

## Memory

One markdown store at `~/.claude/memory/`, local-only (git-ignored at the `.claude` level, never committed):

- Global facts sit flat in `~/.claude/memory/`, indexed by `MEMORY.md`.
- Project facts live under `~/.claude/memory/<owner>/<repo>/`, where `<owner>/<repo>` comes from the repo's git remote. Each project subfolder keeps its own `MEMORY.md`, injected at session start.

A single `graph.json` covers every fact, global and project, and rebuilds automatically whenever a fact file is saved. See [docs/concepts/02-memory-system.md](docs/concepts/02-memory-system.md).

## Layout

- `settings.json`: Claude Code settings (hooks, permissions, env, statusline, plugins).
- `shell/`: the `cc`/`ccd` launcher and its modules (session resume, config-drift detection, transcript retention) plus `worktree.zsh`.
- `hooks/`: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and other hooks (model auto-detect, read/edit guards, memory reminders).
- `statusline.sh`: statusline (git branch, PR/CI status, token usage).
- `output-styles/`: custom output styles.

## Uninstall

```bash
bash ~/.claude/uninstall.sh
```

This removes every shipped file from `~/.claude` and strips the `cc.zsh` source line from `~/.zshrc`. It backs up `.zshrc` before editing.

**Preserved by default:** `settings.json`, `.settings.base.json`, `backups/`, and all runtime state (`sessions/`, `projects/`, `history*`, `plugins/`, `memory/`, `plans/`, `runtime/`, `cache/`, `logs/`, `todos/`, `shell-snapshots/`, `.credentials*`, `cc-state/`, `ccd-state/`).

Pass `--purge` to also remove `settings.json`, `.settings.base.json`, and `backups/`.

**Flags:**

- `--yes`: skip the confirmation prompt.
- `--force`: bypass the git-repo guard (see below).
- `--purge`: remove user config in addition to shipped files.

**Git-repo guard:** if `~/.claude` is a git working tree, the script refuses to run. Raw `rm` leaves index entries dangling; the correct path for decommissioning is `git rm -r <entries>`. Pass `--force` to bypass this guard if you know what you're doing. `--force` bypasses only the git guard; it doesn't skip the confirmation prompt.

## Notes

Config edits (`settings.json` or hooks) take effect on a fresh session only. After changing them, run `cc fresh` or plain `claude`. `cc` warns you when a resumed session runs on stale config. The repo tracks config files, not runtime state. The allowlist `.gitignore` keeps sessions, caches, plugin manifests, and credentials out of git.

## Settings merge

Each `install.sh` run merges the shipped template into your `settings.json` rather than overwriting it. New product config lands automatically; keys you've customised stay as you set them.

The merge tracks a baseline in `~/.claude/.settings.base.json`. On each install it compares that baseline against the new template and your live file to decide which keys to update and which to leave alone.

After each install, check `backups/install-<stamp>/settings-merge-skipped.json`. It lists every key the new template tried to change but your customisation took precedence. Entries look like `{"key":"...", "template_had":..., "yours":...}`. Review them and decide whether to adopt the template value manually.

`permissions` is a single top-level key. If you've customised it (for example, added rules to `permissions.deny`), the whole `permissions` block is treated as contested and the template's version is withheld. Your custom rules take precedence. The skip file will show the entry so you can compare and merge manually if the template shipped new deny rules you want.

If an install is interrupted after writing `settings.json` but before writing the baseline, the files are out of sync. Delete `~/.claude/.settings.base.json` to reset. The next install treats the missing baseline as an empty object and falls back to additive mode: all your keys are kept and new template keys are added.

## Security

The shipped install seed (`settings.shared.json`) carries a conservative permissions default. It drops bare `Bash` and the keychain `security` commands from auto-allow. It moves twelve interpreters (`node`, `python3`, `npx`, `npm`, `make`, `awk`, `go`, `source`, `xargs`, `sqlite3`, `psql`, `docker`) from allow to ask, so the installer gets prompted. This closes the obvious `node -e` and `python3 -c` one-liners.

It's not a sandbox. Some commands still run without a prompt: `git`, `gh`, `find -exec`, the `sed` e-command, and anything under `Bash(**/.claude/**)`. The split lowers the default prompt surface, nothing more.

Autoupdates ship disabled through `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` in the env block. To turn them back on, remove that variable or set it to `0`.
