# Implement: Execute a Verified Plan

Execute an approved implementation plan or ADR blueprint. **This command is execute-only: it does NOT design or plan new scope.** Produce the plan with `/scope` (or `/adr` for an architectural decision) first, then implement it here. The one exception is the Step 8 refinement pass, which re-plans and applies behaviour-preserving cleanups to the code it just wrote (never new features).

Invoked as `/implement`. The remaining arguments are the task reference and flags.

## Help

If the arguments contain `--help`, print this and stop:

```
/implement - Execute an approved plan or ADR blueprint

USAGE:
  /implement                  List saved plans and pick one to execute
  /implement <task-reference> [options]

TASK SOURCES:
  Plan file      /implement .claude/plans/user-avatar-upload.md
  ADR blueprint  /implement .claude/adr/0001-20260625-websocket-push-blueprint.md
  GitHub issue   /implement #42   |   /implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42
  Jira ticket    /implement PROJ-123   (via Atlassian MCP/acli, when reachable)
  File spec      /implement ./tasks/feature-spec.md
  Plain text     /implement "Add user avatar upload"

OPTIONS:
  --help     Show this help
  --auto     Autonomous: execute Work Units in dependency order (independent ones
             concurrently, in isolated worktrees), commit each, open a PR
  --no-tdd   Write tests alongside implementation instead of red/green/refactor
  --force    In --auto mode, override quality-gate FAILs (logged)

PLANNING: /implement never designs. If the reference isn't a ready plan, it
stops and tells you to run /scope or /adr first.

REFINEMENT: after implementing, /implement runs one pass (self quick-review +
SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI simplify, executed autonomously) then an adversarial
review, before finishing (or opening the PR in --auto).
```

## Execution Rules (MUST)

1. **Execute every bash block for real.** Don't simulate or predict output; drive the next step from real output.
2. **No caching.** Every invocation is a fresh run. Don't reuse results from prior conversations or training data.
3. **No skipping.** Execute steps in order. The only exception: steps guarded by a flag the user didn't set.
4. **No assumptions.** Don't guess file contents, command output, or environment state. Run it and read the result.
5. **Follow the command's gates, not your own.** If a step says "ask the user", ask. If it doesn't, don't add a gate.
6. **Show real data.** Tables and reports come from actual command output, never placeholders.

## Step 1: Resolve the Task Reference

**No task reference given (empty, or only flags)?** Run the Plan Picker:

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
found=0
for f in "$ROOT"/.claude/plans/*.md "$ROOT"/.claude/adr/*-blueprint.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  case "$f" in *-quality.md) continue;; esac
  found=1
  title=$(grep -m1 '^#\{1,\} ' "$f" | sed 's/^#\{1,\} *//')
  st=$(grep -m1 -iE 'status' "$f" | grep -ioE 'proposed|accepted|implemented' | head -1)
  printf '%s\t[%s]\t%s\n' "${f#"$ROOT"/}" "${st:-?}" "${title:-untitled}"
done
[ "$found" = 0 ] && echo "NO_PLANS"
```

Present the rows as a numbered menu (index, status, title, path), listing unexecuted entries (`Proposed`/`Accepted`) first and `Implemented` last. Ask the user to pick a number, or to preview one first (Read it, show the summary, then re-ask). If the output is `NO_PLANS`, stop and tell the user to run `/scope` or `/adr` to create one. Use the chosen file as the task reference, then continue below. Any flags passed (e.g. `--auto`) still apply to the chosen plan.

Otherwise, resolve `$ARGUMENTS` (minus flags) by format:

- **Plan/blueprint file** (`.claude/plans/*.md` or `.claude/adr/*-blueprint.md`, or any path ending `.md`): Read it. This is the plan.
- **GitHub issue** (`#N`, or a github.com issue URL): `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,url,labels,state`.
- **Jira ticket** (`ABC-123`): use `mcp__atlassian__*` tools if available, else `acli` if present, else ask the user to paste the ticket. (Same availability rule as `/learn-project`.)
- **Other file path:** Read it.
- **Plain text:** the text is the task statement.

If a fetch fails, ask the user to paste the task content.

## Step 2: Execute-Only Gate (MUST)

Decide whether the resolved reference is a **ready, executable plan**: it names concrete files to change, an ordered set of steps or Work Units, acceptance criteria, and a test plan (Gherkin scenarios or TDD cycles).

- A `/scope` plan or `/adr` blueprint → ready. Proceed.
- A spec/issue/ticket detailed enough (explicit files, steps, acceptance criteria, tests) → ready. Proceed.
- **Anything else** (raw text, a thin issue/ticket, a vague request) → **STOP.** Tell the user: "This isn't a ready plan. Run `/scope` (or `/adr` for an architectural decision) to produce one, then `/implement` it." Do NOT generate a plan inline; planning is `/scope` and `/adr`'s job. (The Step 8 refinement pass is the sole exception, and only to re-plan refactors of code already written, never new scope.)

If the plan or ADR blueprint ends with a "Confidence + open items" trailer, read it and carry the open items as a watch list through execution and the refinement/adversarial review: treat them as the spots most likely to be wrong, and confirm or resolve each before claiming the work done.

## Step 3: Load Standards and Context

- Invoke the `engineering-standards` skill (testing requirements, mocking, PR readiness, deployment), the `grounding-research` skill (verify before asserting), and `writing-style` (for any prose, e.g. commit messages and the PR body).
- If a memory store is present, load it: check whether `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` exists and, if so, read it (cross-project preferences, corrections, conventions); check whether `~/.claude/memory/<owner>/<repo>/MEMORY.md` exists (`<owner>/<repo>` derived from `git remote get-url origin`) and, if so, read it, loading the relevant fact files for conventions, gotchas, and prior decisions. Honor the typed edges: a project fact that contradicts a global one wins for this repo, and surface any conflict bearing on the work rather than silently choosing. If neither store is present, skip this step silently and proceed on the codebase and the plan alone.
- Read every file the plan references before changing it (grounding).
- **Detect the stack** to know the verify commands: check `tsconfig.json` / `package.json` (TS/JS), `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` (Python), `go.mod` (Go), `Cargo.toml` (Rust). Derive the type-check / lint / test commands from what you find.

**Knowledge capture:** when you discover a durable convention or gotcha, write it as a project memory fact only if a project store is present at `~/.claude/memory/<owner>/<repo>/`; otherwise skip silently.

## Step 4: Quality Gate (conditional)

If the plan came from `/scope` or `/adr` it already has a companion `*-quality.md` report; trust it and skip to Step 5. Otherwise (a file/issue/ticket spec), run the inlined 3-phase gate before executing:

1. **Fact-Check** (`Explore` agent, under `grounding-research`): every referenced path exists, signatures/imports match, downstream consumers identified, test infra present.
2. **Adversarial Review** (`general-purpose` agent + the fact-check report): simpler alternatives, scope creep, missing error paths, blast radius.
3. **Test Review** (`Explore` agent, under `engineering-standards`): regression-pinning, flakiness, independence, mock quality, assertion strength.

Max 3 iterations per phase; revise on FAIL. A FAIL blocks execution unless the user explicitly overrides (or `--auto --force`). If a project store is present at `~/.claude/memory/<owner>/<repo>/`, record gotchas and rejected alternatives as memory facts; otherwise skip silently.

## Step 5: Execute (delegated subagents, reviewed)

**Delegation (MUST):** this command runs on Sonnet. The orchestrating session reads the plan and delegates each implementation chunk to a subagent via the Task tool, then reviews the result. Delegation keeps each chunk in a fresh, isolated context (no bleed between cycles); the orchestrator spends its turn reviewing, not editing. Independent Work Units run in parallel by default, each isolated in its own git worktree, with the model tier set per role (see the scheduler below). The deep design reasoning already happened in `/scope` or `/adr`, so execution doesn't need Opus.

Every Task prompt MUST include: the full plan content, the specific cycle/step/Work Unit, its Gherkin scenarios, the test-structure rules below, the verify command, the design principles below, and grounding rules ("read files before modifying, match existing style, verify imports resolve, don't guess types, apply SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI").

**Design principles (MUST).** Every change, and every Task prompt, applies:
- **SOLID:** one responsibility per unit, small focused interfaces, depend on abstractions only at real seams (no abstraction without a second caller).
- **DRY:** factor out genuine duplication once it recurs (rule of three); don't couple unrelated code that only looks alike.
- **KISS:** the simplest design that passes the tests and reads clearly; fewer moving parts wins.
- **YAGNI:** build only what the plan requires now. No speculative hooks, flags, config, or generality.

When SOLID's abstraction pulls against KISS/YAGNI, favour the simplest thing that meets the plan. These principles are also the lens for the refinement pass (Step 8).

**Execution unit (MUST): the plan's Work Units.** Execute one Work Unit (deliverable) at a time in dependency order; each WU becomes one small commit.

**Parallel-by-default scheduler (MUST).** Don't wait for the plan to pre-label groups. Build the WU dependency graph from the `Requires` column and run the acyclicity check (the procedure in Step 6) now, before executing. Then execute in waves until every WU is done:

1. **Ready set.** The WUs whose `Requires` are all complete.
2. **Form a wave.** Take the largest subset of the ready set that's safe to run together. Parallel is the default. Two ready WUs run sequentially ONLY when one of these forces it:
   - a real dependency edge between them (transitive `Requires`),
   - their `Files` lists intersect,
   - shared mutable state: both touch a denylisted shared surface (migration dirs; lockfiles `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`; generated, barrel, or index files; global registries; codegen outputs), or there's genuine doubt about shared state.

   A plan `Parallel group` annotation, when present, confirms safety but isn't required. A WU that clashes with the forming wave drops to a later wave.
3. **Dispatch the wave concurrently.** Issue the Task calls in a single message so they run at once, one worktree per WU (see Worktree isolation). A wave of one runs in the main tree with no worktree. Give each Task a stable `name`; the moment it returns its result, call `TaskStop` on it. A spawned agent stays idle-alive for `SendMessage` follow-ups and this flow never reuses a finished one, so leaving it unstopped keeps it running in the background.
4. **Integrate, then recompute.** After the wave returns, integrate (below), append to the ledger, then recompute the ready set for the next wave.

Scope each WU's verify command to its own test files (the full suite runs in Step 7) so an in-progress sibling can't trip another's tests.

**Worktree isolation (parallel waves).** For each WU in a multi-WU wave:

- `git worktree add "$ROOT/.claude/worktrees/<plan-slug>/<wu-id>" HEAD` off the current branch, one per WU.
- Dispatch the implementer to work in that worktree path (absolute paths in its brief). It implements, runs its scoped verify, and commits inside the worktree. It does NOT push.
- **Integrate:** cherry-pick each WU's commit onto the main branch in dependency order. Disjoint files make this conflict-free. If a cherry-pick conflicts, the safety test was violated: STOP, keep the worktrees, and report. Then `git worktree remove` each.
- Single-WU waves skip the worktree and run in the main tree.

**File-based handoff.** Keep the orchestrator's context clean over long runs:

- Write each WU's brief (its `Files`, `Changes`, `Test scenarios`, `Done When`, the worktree path, and the scoped verify command) to `.claude/implement/<plan-slug>/<wu-id>.brief.md` and point the subagent at that file, instead of pasting the whole plan into every prompt.
- The implementer writes its full report to `<wu-id>.report.md` and returns ONLY: a status (`DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `BLOCKED`, or `NEEDS_CONTEXT`), its commit SHAs, and a one-line test result.

**Verify-by-diff (MUST).** Never take the subagent's word. After a WU returns, confirm the work from git (`git show --stat <sha>`, review the diff against the brief) and the scoped verify. A `DONE` the diff doesn't support is a failure: re-dispatch or stop per Error handling.

**Progress ledger.** Append each completed WU to `.claude/implement/<plan-slug>.progress.md` (gitignored): WU id, status, commit range. On a fresh run or after compaction, read the ledger first and skip WUs already recorded done. First use in a repo, create and ignore the dir:

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
mkdir -p "$ROOT/.claude/implement"
for d in .claude/implement/ .claude/worktrees/; do
  grep -qxF "$d" "$ROOT/.gitignore" 2>/dev/null || printf '%s\n' "$d" >> "$ROOT/.gitignore"
done
```

**Model tiering (MUST, never omit `model`).** Implementer Tasks run `model: "sonnet"`. Mechanical bits (brief extraction, ledger writes) run `model: "haiku"`. Verification and the adversarial review (Step 9) run the capable tier. An omitted `model` silently inherits the priciest default, so always set it.

**Test structure (from `engineering-standards`):** every test follows Arrange-Act-Assert with `// Arrange` / `// Act` / `// Assert` comments mapping to the scenario's Given/When/Then; one action per test; use parameterised tests (`test.each`, `pytest.mark.parametrize`, table-driven) when scenarios share AAA structure but differ in data.

**With TDD (default).** For each cycle within a Work Unit (in dependency order):

1. **RED** - Sonnet Task: "Write ONLY the failing tests encoding this Gherkin scenario, AAA-structured. Don't touch production code." Then run the verify command: tests MUST fail (if they pass, the test proves nothing - fix it).
2. **GREEN** - Sonnet Task: "Write ONLY the minimal implementation to pass." Run verify: tests MUST pass (on failure, spawn a follow-up Task with the error output).
3. **REFACTOR** - Sonnet Task: "Clean up without changing behaviour; tests stay green." Run verify.
4. **Orchestrator review:** read the modified files; confirm changes match the plan, doc comments explain WHY, no unplanned side effects.

**Without TDD (`--no-tdd`).** For each logical file group: one Sonnet Task implements code + tests together (tests still encode the Gherkin scenarios); run verify; the orchestrator reviews as above.

**Commit per Work Unit (MUST): small commits.** One coherent commit per WU.

- **Parallel wave (worktree):** the implementer commits its WU inside its worktree, staging exactly its `Files` (it does not push). During integration the orchestrator cherry-picks each commit onto the main branch in dependency order, then pushes the branch once (`git push`). Confirm each WU's files landed (`git log --stat`).
- **Single-WU wave (main tree):** after the orchestrator review passes, stage exactly that WU's files (`git add <the WU's Files list>`) and run `/commit-and-push -y`. Confirm the files are committed (they no longer appear in `git status --porcelain`).

If a commit or cherry-pick fails, retry once, then stop and report.

## Step 6: Autonomous Mode (`--auto`)

`--auto` executes Work Units in dependency order, committing each, then opens a PR. It commits and pushes without pausing, so:

- **Branch first.** If on the default branch, create a feature branch before any commit (never auto-commit to the default branch). Never `--no-verify`, never force-push.
- A FAIL in Step 4 blocks; `--force` overrides it (logged to the quality report).

**Cycle check (MUST, before executing, both modes).** Step 5's scheduler runs this before any wave; in `--auto` it's the same check. Verify the Work Unit dependency graph is acyclic:

1. Build the adjacency list from the plan's Work Units table (`WU-N -> [Requires]`).
2. Count incoming edges per WU; seed a queue with the zero-incoming WUs.
3. Process the queue: mark each WU resolved, decrement the count of every WU it enables, enqueue any that hit zero.
4. If any WU is unresolved, those form a cycle: name them, break the cycle (extract shared logic into a new WU, merge, or reverse an edge), and re-check.

Report the result: `Cycle check: PASS (N WUs resolve in topological order)` or how a detected cycle was fixed.

**Per Work Unit (or parallel batch), in dependency order:**

1. Confirm all WUs in the "Requires" column are done.
2. Dispatch each wave with the Step 5 parallel-by-default scheduler (ready set, safety test, worktree isolation, integration). Don't gate on `Parallel group` annotations; parallelize whatever the safety test allows, sequential only when forced. Within a WU, WU-0 types first, then the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR flow per cycle (or a single Task for `--no-tdd`), delegated to Sonnet.
3. **Post-WU review:** changes match each WU's spec and file plan; doc comments explain WHY; no files outside the file plan touched.
4. Commit and integrate per the Step 5 commit rules: implementers commit inside their worktrees, the orchestrator cherry-picks in dependency order and pushes; single-WU waves commit in the main tree.
5. Mark each WU's "Done When" checkboxes in the plan file.

**Error handling:** if a WU fails (verify fails, wrong output, or commit fails) after 3 fix retries, **stop**. Don't continue to dependent WUs. Report the failed WU, the error, and the remaining WUs.

## Step 7: Validate

Run the project's checks (from Step 3 detection), e.g. type-check, lint, and tests. In `--auto`, run the full suite (not just affected) and, on failure, spawn a Sonnet Task to fix the responsible WU, then amend via `/commit-and-push -ya` (max 3 attempts; if still failing, stop and do NOT open a PR).

- Fix and re-validate until green.
- **Doc audit:** every new/modified function has a doc comment explaining WHY; add any that are missing.
- **Update status:** change the plan's `Status: Proposed` to `Status: Implemented`.
- **Memory capture:** if a project store is present at `~/.claude/memory/<owner>/<repo>/`, record notable errors and their fixes as memory facts; otherwise skip silently. The graph rebuilds automatically on fact save via the PostToolUse hook.

In `--auto`, after validation passes, continue to the refinement pass (Step 8). The PR opens at the end of Step 9, after the refinement and adversarial review pass, not here.

## Step 8: Refinement Pass (one pass, autonomous)

Once the implementation is green, run ONE refinement pass over the code you just produced. It runs autonomously (no pause, in interactive and `--auto` alike) and executes exactly once per `/implement` invocation; re-validation never re-enters this step. It refines existing code; it does NOT add new scope (YAGNI keeps `/implement` execute-only). Apply the same commit safety as Step 6: if on the default branch, create a feature branch before committing; never commit to the default branch; never force-push.

1. **Self quick-review (local).** Apply the `grounding-review` discipline to the branch diff: severity-classified findings, each with `file:line` evidence. Keep it local; don't post anything. Fix only the findings you hold with HIGH confidence (clear bug, dead code, obvious simplification). Leave low-confidence or speculative findings for the adversarial review (Step 9); don't guess.
2. **Simplify & refactor analysis.** Read the changed files through the Design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI). List concrete, behaviour-preserving changes: collapse needless indirection, delete dead or speculative code, dedupe real repetition, flatten tangled control flow, tighten names. Skip anything that changes behaviour or adds abstraction with no second caller.
3. **Re-plan.** Fold the high-confidence fixes and accepted simplifications into a small set of refinement Work Units (same shape as a `/scope` plan: `Files`, `Requires`, `Done When`). Scope is limited to code already written. If a finding implies new feature work, record it as a follow-up; don't build it.
4. **Execute autonomously.** Run the refinement Work Units like `--auto`: TDD where it applies, behaviour-preserving refactors keep tests green, commit each WU with `/commit-and-push -y`. Then re-run the validation checks from Step 7 (type-check/lint/test only, not the status flip or the continue-to-Step-8 handoff); they MUST stay green.

Run this pass once. Don't loop: Step 9 is the backstop for whatever remains.

## Step 9: Adversarial Review (MUST)

This reviews the IMPLEMENTED work, not the plan: Step 4's adversarial review ran before execution against the plan; this one runs after, against the diff. Dispatch it as a swarm of lens-specialized reviewers in parallel (each reads the diff, none writes, so parallel is always safe): issue one Task per lens in a single message, each a `general-purpose` agent on the capable tier under the `grounding-review` discipline, with the full branch diff, the plan, and the refinement notes. Each lens tries to break the work, not bless it:

- **Correctness:** bugs, off-by-one, unhandled errors, regressions the tests miss.
- **Behaviour drift:** did any simplification or refactor change observable behaviour?
- **Principles:** remaining SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI violations, leftover speculative code, needless abstraction.
- **Scope:** anything built beyond the plan; anything the plan required but is missing.
- **Tests:** weak assertions, missing boundary or regression coverage, flakiness.

Give each reviewer Task a stable `name` and call `TaskStop` on it the moment it returns its findings. Reviewer agents stay idle-alive after returning; this flow never reuses them, so stop each one immediately.

Each lens returns severity-classified findings with `file:line` evidence and a fix per finding. **Consolidate:** merge the returns, dedup overlapping findings, drop anything already addressed, and fact-check each surviving finding against the file at HEAD before acting (discard stale or hallucinated ones). Then apply the fixes you hold with HIGH confidence plus every blocking correctness/security finding, and re-run the Step 7 validation checks. Surface the rest as known follow-ups: don't silently drop them, and don't start a second refinement loop.

**Finish.** In interactive mode, report the applied fixes and unresolved follow-ups to the user; leave the PR to them. In `--auto`, once the Step 7 validation checks are green after the adversarial fixes, open the PR with `gh pr create` (title and body from the plan and commit history, in the `writing-style` voice), listing the unresolved non-blocking findings under a "Follow-ups" heading.

## Decision Rules

| Scenario | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Reference isn't a ready plan | STOP; tell the user to run `/scope` or `/adr` first (Step 2) |
| Task is ambiguous | Ask the user before executing |
| Plan needs new dependencies | List them and ask for approval (vet maintenance/license/CVEs) |
| Touches auth/security code | Flag for extra review; be conservative |
| Requires a DB migration | Execute the migration as its own unit with a rollback note |
| Validation fails | Fix and re-validate before reporting done |
| `--auto`: WU fails after 3 retries | Stop; report the failed WU and the remaining WUs |
| `--auto`: validation fails after 3 fixes (including Step 8/9 re-validations) | Stop; report; do NOT open a PR |
| `--auto`: on the default branch | Create a feature branch before the first commit |
| `--auto`: commit/push fails | Stop; report (auth, hooks, etc.) |
| Refinement (Step 8) implies new feature scope | Record as a follow-up; don't build it (YAGNI) |
| Adversarial review (Step 9) finds a blocking issue | Fix it, re-validate, then finish; report non-blocking findings as follow-ups |
| Refinement or adversarial fix would change behaviour | Don't fold it into the refactor; treat it as a separate fix and re-validate |

## Teardown (MUST run, even on failure or abort)

`TaskStop` every subagent spawned in this flow that is still alive: implementer Tasks from each wave, quality-gate agents from Step 4, and adversarial reviewer Tasks from Step 9. Confirm via `TaskList` that no tasks from this run remain before finishing.
