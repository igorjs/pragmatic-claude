"""Build a commit message for a squashed run of commits.

The message must read like an ordinary commit describing the code changes and must
never reveal that commits were combined or that timestamps were altered — otherwise
the whole point (an unremarkable history) is lost. An AI summary is preferred; a
deterministic fallback to a real existing message keeps the engine working offline,
and a banned-word filter guarantees the no-intent rule even if the model misbehaves.
